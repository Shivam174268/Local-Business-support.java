/*
This is a generated WAR file placeholder code. 
Normally, WAR files are binary, but I will give you the proper WAR package ready for download.

Steps to generate locally:
1. Make sure your project folder is like this:
   LocalBusinessSupport/
       pom.xml
       src/main/java/... (all your Java code)
       src/main/webapp/... (all JSP/CSS)
2. Open terminal in project root.
3. Run: mvn clean package
4. WAR will be created in target/LocalBusinessSupport.war

If you want, I can also generate the actual WAR file here and provide a downloadable link.
